    "#### The most important features of the AlexNet paper are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the model had to train 60 million parameters (which is quite a lot), it was prone to overfitting. According to the paper, the usage of Dropout and Data Augmentation significantly helped in reducing overfitting. The first and second fully connected layers in the architecture thus used a dropout of 0.5 for the purpose. Artificially increasing the number of images through data augmentation helped in the expansion of the dataset dynamically during runtime, which helped the model generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another distinct factor was using the ReLU activation function instead of tanh or sigmoid, which resulted in faster training times (a decrease in training time by 6 times). Deep Learning Networks usually employ ReLU non-linearity to achieve faster training times as the others start saturating when they hit higher activation values."

    "- Since number of filters = 96 , thus output of first Layer is : 55x55x96\n",

    "- Next we have the MaxPooling again ,reducing the size to 13x13x256. Another Convolutional Operation with 384, (3,3) filters having same padding is applied twice giving the output as 13x13x384, followed by another Convulutional Layer with 256 , (3,3) filters and same padding resulting in 13x13x256 output. \n",
    "- This is MaxPooled and dimensions are reduced to 6x6x256. Further the layer is Flatten out and 2 Fully Connected Layers with 4096 units each are made which is further connected to 1000 units softmax layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The network is used for classifying much large number of classes as per our requirement. However in our case, we will make the output softmax layer with 6 units as we ahve to classify into 6 classes. The softmax layer gives us the probablities for each class to which an Input Image might belong."

Compared to the general linear model, a regular method is used to prevent the model from overfitting. In the neural network, Dropout is implemented by modifying the structure of the neural network itself. For a certain layer of neurons, randomly delete some neurons with a defined probability, while keeping the individuals of the input layer and output layer neurons unchanged, and then update the parameters according to the learning method of the neural network. In the next iteration, rerandom Remove some neurons until the end of training.\n",
